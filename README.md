# Unreal Breakout Project (UE5.4.4)

![the project in unreal engine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mellurboo/UnrealBreakout/refs/heads/main/.github/hero.png)

My own unreal engine breakout clone for school. It was a good project and has probably the most unoptimised UI code. wonderful, Maybe I'll come back and fix it for fun but as of right now I have some big ahh project to do and I don't have time.

Either way feel free to open the project, go ahead and learn from it.
